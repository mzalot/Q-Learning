1. What is Q Learning? What does the Q stand for (and what about the "Learning")?
Q learning is a model free reinforcement learning algorithm which works to learn a policy that maximizes the total reward or the best option. Model free means it does not need to have a the model of the environment it is running in. Q learning can handle environments that change and rewards without changing the learning algorithm. The Q stands for quality because the algorithm finds the best option at a given state. Q-learning finds the path of actions that gets the greatest award. The learning part is that the algorithm learns the best way to do something that has the maximum yield.

2. What is RL (Reinforcement Learning) and how does it relate to ML (Machine Learning)?
Reinforcement learning is learning through doing something many times until you find the best way to do it. Machine learning uses data to predict and make decisions without humans telling the program to do so. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence. It could be used inside of Reinforcement learning to make more accurate predictions.

3. What does it mean for Q Learning to be "model-free"?
It means that the Q learning algorithm does not need to have the model of the environment it is running in to work.

4. What, if anything, is Q Learning often used for? (If you find any cool projects or research relating to Q Learning, feel free to link them to me!)
